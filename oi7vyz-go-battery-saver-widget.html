After removal I would be at 50-70% battery through the whole 10 hrs no charging. Can’t wait for Snowboard.

I've got a Mi 8, loving it so far, but today my alarm didn't go off and I was late to an important meeting! No idea why!

Function and form are the main deciding factors. It’s not meant to be a list of absolutes. The set will flex and shift as I discover new or better apps. If you’re angry that I omitted X and Y or disregarded Z, that’s okay. It’s possible that I haven’t stumble upon a particular app yet. It’s also very possible that I have and simply hated it. Give this list a fair chance before sending me anything. Thanks to Android and all the fantastic. 
Hello everyone! I want to share my experience with using my iPhone 7+ 256gb. I know I'm late to the party but I wanted at least give it a couple months before I even thought of writing this. I work on phones and other tech for a living so over the years I've collected a good bit of cellphones, all ranging from the iPhone 3G-7+ and the too many android phones to count (I used to have ATampT and could switch phones anytime I wanted since my sim card activated them on the spot) I always. So I wake up this morning to first realize all of my messages have disappeared but it still took up the space on my phone, Then I learned it was just glitching out but still deleted all my messages and showed that the messages app was taking up no space. Then I go to the photo library to see when I select an image it is very badly pixelated and when I go to play a video it does an endless circle loop thing acting like it's loading and when I go to delete a photo it disappears but still Over the last day or so I've had multiple apps crashing repeatedly, including music, reddit, catan, and most annoyingly cydia and crashreporter. Crashreporter won't even register the latest crashes before it crashes itself. And I can't uninstall potential culprits because of cydia crashing. I had to hard restart my phone to get out of jailbreak to be able to post this. Any suggestions? I'm on iPhone se running 10.2. Eta tweak list: 7-zip (POSIX): 4.57-3p Activator: 1.9.13~beta1 Anchor: 2.0.4. 
PART 1/4 Re-Submitted without a certain Box-like App. So I picked up an iPhone 6 to replace my 4S and decided for the first time I would try Jailbreaking over my Christmas break. It’s been a long journey these past few weeks, exploring all the repos and sites like /r/Jailbreak looking for tweaks I might find useful. Boot loops and screen freezes have led to me becoming familiar with things like “putty” and “iFunBox” and I’ve had to do an iLEX restore at least 3 times to solve really persis. Hello everyone. I visit this subreddit often, and one of the topics that comes up regularly is battery life. Unfortunately, these posts tend to be of the extreme variety, generally depicting fairly awesome usage, such as say 1.5 days to 2 days of full use, or something along the lines of 6-7 hours of SOT. The other type are people with low battery performance, with their phones dying at around 8 hours or getting no more than 2 hours SOT. The positive spectrum I would like to address. Yesterday I received my new Vivo 5r and spent the day setting things up. When playing with the settings I entered extreme mode, which is in the pull up toggle settings. The extreme mode erased my widgets but, I noticed later it said it would so, no biggie. I downloaded Google now launcher and tried out extreme mode on it. BIG MISTAKE. Instead of the simple screen it kept the regular home screen but, deleted the app icons off the screen except a few. I couldn't get back out of extreme Hello. I have had a Samsung Galaxy S III phone as well as a 2013 Google Nexus Tablet. I plan on getting the newest Google Nexus Smartphone/Phablet that is coming out this year because I now have a desktop at home for internet, etc. amp will no longer need my tablet in the future. In the past, I have downloaded a LOT of apps throughout both devices in which I currently have, amp I'm looking forward to putting certain apps all under one roof through the next Google Nexus phone in the future. Heyo. I'll be showing my iOS 7 setup. I gotten inspired by MANY people's setups the past few days and I think the one I have right now is a keeper. The one I got inspired the most is by /u/x4am_dashup showing his iOS 7 setup.(I Hope you don't mind me using your format!)
